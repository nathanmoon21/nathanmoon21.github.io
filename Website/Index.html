    <h2><center>Some Information About Myself/center></center></h2>
    
    <p><center>My name is Robert Nathaniel Moon. I am from Buena Vista Georgia, and am a Junior at
    the University of Georgia. I am studying for a Finance degree and will apply to Terry 
    College next semester. After getting my degree I intend on either working in Atlanta, or my family is
    constantly insistent that I work with them. I am still uncertain of what job I want so only time will 
    tell.</center></p> 
    
    <p><center>My interests include country music, cars, and anything outdoors. My boyfriend and I love
    to go hiking and enjoy driving to the North Georgia Mountains and to Highlands North 
    Carolina. Due to growing up in the middle of nowhere, I love any rural location.</center></p>
    
    <p><center>I am hoping to get my degree from UGA and then I intend on entering the work force. I am
    considering going to Law School, however I want to gain some real world work experience 
    before I make the decision to pursue it. Currently I work downtown bartending at a 
    restaurant called The Office.</center></p>
